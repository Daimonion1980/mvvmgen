# Welcome to the MvvmGen Docs

**MvvmGen** is a modern and lightweight MVVM library that is built 
on top of C# Source Generators.

Here in the docs you'll learn about its features. Beside the docs,
please also check out [the MvvmGen Samples repository](https://github.com/thomasclaudiushuber/mvvmgen-samples) 
that contains full applications built with WPF, WinUI, and MvvmGen.

You can read the docs on GitHub like a web page. 
At the end of each section you find a link to the next section.
