# Welcome to the MvvmGen Docs

**MvvmGen** is a modern and lightweight MVVM library that is built 
on top of C# Source Generators. It is a "Source Generator First/Only" framework 
that contains everything that you need to build XAML applications with the popular 
Model-View-ViewModel-pattern (MVVM):
- A `ViewModelBase` class
- An `ICommand` implementation
- An EventAggregator to communicate between ViewModels
- Attributes like `ViewModel`, `Property`, `Command`
and `Inject` that you use to hook up MvvmGenâ€™s C# Source Generator, the 
so-called `ViewModelGenerator`

Here in the docs you'll learn about the features of **MvvmGen**. Beside the docs,
please also check out [the MvvmGen Samples repository](https://github.com/thomasclaudiushuber/mvvmgen-samples) 
that contains full applications built with WPF, WinUI, and MvvmGen.

You can read the docs on GitHub like a web page. 
At the end of each section you find a link to the next section.
