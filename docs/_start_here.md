## Welcome to the MvvmGen docs

MvvmGen is a modern and lightweight MVVM library that is built on top of C# Source Generators.

Here in the docs you'll learn about its features. Beside the docs, please also check out [the MvvmGen Samples repository](https://github.com/thomasclaudiushuber/mvvmgen-samples) that contains full applications built with WPF, WinUI, and MvvmGen.

You can read the docs on GitHub like a web page. At the end of each section you find a link to the next section. Here the separate parts:

- [Create a ViewModel](https://github.com/thomasclaudiushuber/mvvmgen/blob/main/docs/01_create_a_viewModel.md).
- [Define Properties](https://github.com/thomasclaudiushuber/mvvmgen/blob/main/docs/02_define_properties.md).
